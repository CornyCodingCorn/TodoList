Must have:
 - Tasks with timer to keep track
 - CRUD Tasks
 - Keep track of how many task has been done
 - Total working time
 - Compile data
Nice to have:
 - Reactive UI
 - Accounts for online
 - A website
 
 Task item:
  - Icon to show the status
  - A name description
  - Click will show a dropdown
  - The dropdown will show a full info
  - Style the item dropdown - Done
  
 Fix bug:
  - Change animation data type to correct one because C# doesn't automatically type cast object to type
