## ðŸ“– ABOUT
A simple todo list app that is cross-platform and simple but still has enough feature for managing daily tasks.</br>
This app aims to fix the lack of app that fit right in the middle of being features rich and just a simple app that everyone does as a tutorial (I actually don't know, don't quote me Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ ). </br>
